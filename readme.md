I am so done with this greedy and unforgivable school. This school has caused me so much insomina and stress trying to be good enough for any of you. 
But not once was it good enough for any of these greedy staff members. This is my resignation log and I will never return
I will perform one more act to just to prove im worth something other than the IT department for the school
ATBEEF (Actually the best exploit ever found)
This will bypass any restrictions: https://willing-stefa-alexisthen-aad069f3.koyeb.app/ have fun.

Have fun worshipping this school that coulden't give a care in the world for the students mental health.
All this school tried to be only poured down on me. I tried to be the greatest student I could but not one thing was good enough for any of you.
You guys only expected things, Never asked polietly. Remix the replit link and sign up. Run it and enjoy freedom which this school decided to lock up.
This school was a place to break down our mental health and sanity to it's last breaking point. I have been accused of things I woulden't even dare to say to myself.
But you guys only went against me, I wish this school the worst days of luck. here's the guide to crack Student passwords.

First get their whole name (exm. John Doe)
And then their lunch number and do this:
JoXXXXDo
The X is the lunch number.
(exm. Jo3331Do)

The way I learned at a young age was because of my Dad, he has been disrespected by many staff members here, same with students. But once again you guys never cared about my Health.
You always thought I was faking everything. The allegations against me saying I cause the power outage, Goguardian Maintenence, and lagging in our school chromebooks. Please note:
Our chromebook can only cache about 4 MB of CPU and 4GB of RAM. Which causes the lag. And I have zero control over that other stuff. Idc if the school tries to punish me.
Im done with this school. I've told you over at the Main office to stop countless times. But you ignored me plenty of times. Idc if this was a misunderstanding. This is my heart
speaking whenever i say that this school is not a good school to bring your children too. And yes I will make this public and you can not stop me. 

I will now drop info of this school.
Should not have seen me as JUST a tech guy.

-------------------------------------------------
Now here is a teacher email sent to me in 3rd grade:
<Janet> Maybe if you did better you woulden't be such a failure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I will take full control and responsibility of what comes for me next. But at this point I could not care less. This school never onced said sorry to me, NOT ONCE.
Do not let your childeren attend here. And yes i am aware that i violated the COC. But this is something in the handbook clearly stated:
Student safety is the responsibility of the staff. All staff members are familiar with emergency procedures such as fire, lockdown and tornado drills and accident reporting procedures. 
Should a student be aware of any dangerous situation or accident, s/he must notify any staff person immediately.  State law requires that all students must have an emergency medical card completed, signed by a parent or guardian, and filed in the School office. A student may be excluded from school until this requirement has been fulfilled.
Students with specific health care needs should deliver written notice about such needs along with proper documentation by a physician, to the School Office. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was never given to us in school. Not a trace was given to us. And all the emergency protocols are not up to state standards:
Code 20-34-3-20:
"All students and staff must be prepared and alerted ahead of time"
Us students are almost never alerted of a drill,
And our "life saving" way is just stupid. We wait 2 FULL minutes before we can leave. Our first responders do not move quickly so when the alarm starts screaming. We have to wait
until told there is a fire. Isn't that the point of the fire alarm?
I am done typing as im 100% in trouble for doing this. This will be going out to every student to the email: allstudent@hcs.k12.in.us
Please take some time to read through instead of skipping. Have a good afternoon or morning.
